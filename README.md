# WIP: This Minecraft Skin Does Not Exist

Inspired by [This Person Does Not Exist](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com).

The goal of this project is to generate minecraft skins using a GAN.
Training data is scraped from planet minecraft.

## Why?
This is a relatively simple example which I thought would be fun to learn about GANs with. Minecraft skins are 64x32 (if you don't use the second layer) images. Because they are small, I can use my limited resources to train a GAN on them.
